          “These two generations are likely to spend more money with their favorite retailers if those retailers sell second hand (HMR Brand) OR HAVE an Environmentally conscious way dealing with returned and excess stock”, especially Apparel re-sale is the go to fashion staple for socially conscious millennials and Gen-Z.
            With global demand increasing continuously, a key lever to reach global environmental targets is through a more efficient use of resources, as 45% of current GHG emissions are attributed to products.
            The circular economy alone can provide a 45% decrease, or 9.3 Gt CO2, by 2050 in just five key materials – steel, cement, plastic, aluminum, food.
            Returned and excess items create an average of over 5B-lbs of landfill waste every year.
            Green Deal models in Retail and Logistics (Re-Commerce) offer growth opportunities due to inevitable shift in consumer preference and government regulations, Green product choices consumers are willing to pay for due to long term environmental & health benefits

            Sustainability is at the heart of our vision to create the best places. It is not a compliance burden but a strategic differentiator that enables us to focus on making a positive impact in everything that we do. HRL sustainability strategy focuses on three sustainability imperatives that drive our vision. These imperatives are supported by environmental and social focus areas under which we set specific targets. Allowing us to measure progress and performance over time. This report highlights some of the ways in which we put our sustainability vision into practice; minimizing our environmental impact and creating a positive legacy for local communities.
